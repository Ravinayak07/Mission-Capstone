# Abstract:
- As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, the task of detecting security vulnerabilities has become a major challenge for modern cybersecurity. This study investigates how machine learning can be used to automate the detection of common security flaws in websites, with a focus on phishing attacks. The study examined a dataset containing more than 11,000 websites, with 32 distinct features, including URL structure, domain information, and traffic patterns. Various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, were tested during the analysis. Each model was assessed using important performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Of all the models tested, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines performed the best, achieving the highest accuracy and F1 scores. This paper highlights how machine learning can enhance vulnerability detection, making the process faster and more accurate. The findings suggest that machine learning tools have the potential to transform cybersecurity by speeding up threat detection and providing more insightful, context-aware risk assessments.

# Introduction:
- The swift advancement of digital technology is making our online spaces more susceptible to cyber threats with phishing attacks being particularly prominent. Both individuals and organizations now face difficulty recognizing phishing attacks because they have become more sophisticated. Phishing attacks deceive individuals into sharing sensitive data such as login credentials by impersonating credible entities [1]. Many cyber security tools are in widespread use but they fail to match the advanced attack techniques implemented by hackers. The situation demonstrates a rising demand for advanced automated systems able to detect these threats as they happen. The research investigates how machine learning techniques can develop a vulnerability scanner that detects frequent website security weaknesses, especially phishing attacks.

- Detecting security vulnerabilities in real-time remains a critical challenge within cyber security. Multiple solutions exist to tackle cyber security issues through rule-based scanners and manual audits but these approaches frequently operate at a slow pace and suffer from human mistakes. The deployment of machine learning techniques provides an effective solution to vulnerability detection through automated processes that enhance detection accuracy. Machine learning algorithms' growing application in cyber security now supports dynamic response systems that evolve alongside emerging threats. Many systems continue to depend on static rule sets which fail to identify fresh unknown vulnerabilities despite recent technological progress. The study seeks to overcome current limitations by developing a machine learning-based scanner which can autonomously spot phishing vulnerabilities while delivering tailored mitigation guidelines [2].

- Machine learning-based vulnerability detection offers some clear advantages over traditional methods. For starters, machine learning models are excellent at detecting evolving threats because they can analyze large datasets and uncover patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. Additionally, as more data becomes available, these models can continue to improve, making them more accurate and adaptable over time. That being said, using machine learning for phishing detection does come with its challenges. These include interpreting the models, especially in the context of cybersecurity, ensuring real-time data processing, and keeping the training data of high quality[3].

- This study examines the automated identification of website vulnerabilities, particularly phishing assaults, using machine learning. The objective is to develop a scanner that uses machine learning to evaluate multiple criteria, facilitating the differentiation of reliable websites from phishing ones.These features include things like URL structure, domain information, and traffic patternsâ€”characteristics often found in phishing websites[3]. The study will test different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to find the most effective one for detecting phishing threats. The research will focus on two key ideas: (1) machine learning models can outperform traditional, rule-based methods in spotting phishing websites, and (2) models trained on a large, varied dataset will produce more accurate and reliable results[4]

- This Paper organized is as follows: An outline of the data collecting process and the preprocessing actions required in getting the dataset ready for model training will be given in the following part. A thorough discussion of the machine learning models applied in this work, together with their advantages and shortcomings in the framework of vulnerability detection, will follow here. The results of the model evaluations will be shown in the next part together with a comparison of the models' performance depending on important criteria including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results will then be examined in the discussion section together with possible difficulties and future directions for research, so addressing real-world application. At last, the paper will close by compiling the major contributions.

# Literature Review:
- Machine learning was the buzzword for detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the recent past. Numerous studies have been conducted on how machine learning can detect phishing attacks. One of them, for example, explored how phishing URLs can be separated based on their features using supervised models such as Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Smith et al., 2020). In detecting new phishing tactics, the study concluded that machine learning models are more dynamic and accurate compared to the rule-based method. It also emphasized the significance of feature engineering, highlighting as indicators of phishing pages domain names, URL lengths, and suspicious keywords[5]

- Likewise, Williams and Zhao (2019) investigated the use of deep learning methods in phishing detection, specifically the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for visual pattern scanning on websites. It was reported that the use of deep learning models made it possible to extract advanced features from website image representations, and these were better in detecting phishing websites that use deceptive design elements to camouflage as known brands. The method, as promising as it was, also posed the question of how to generate labeled datasets that capture a range of website formats and styles in order to allow the generalization of deep learning models to new phishing tactics. Their work indicated that a hybrid approach of CNNs and conventional machine learning models could be more efficient[6]

- An alternate line of inquiry examined the role of unsupervised learning in phishing detection. By classifying websites based on similarity metrics of their URLs and domains, researchers were able to detect potentially phishing websites without the need for labeled data (Lee & Kim, 2021). To identify strange patterns in website data that might indicate phishing activity, they used anomaly detection and K-means clustering techniques. One advantage of this approach is that it can detect new phishing websites without the need for a pre-compiled list of popular phishing websites. Optimizing the clustering algorithms to reduce false positives and increase detection precision remains a challenge[7]

- Another applicable research field is ensemble method application through multiple models coming together to strengthen prediction accuracy. Chen et al. (2018), for instance, suggested utilizing Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Random Forests for detecting phishing attacks. By minimizing variance and maximizing resistance to overfitting, their research demonstrated how ensemble methods bettered single models to a considerable degree. For making models more interpretable, they demonstrated how, specifically, Random Forests performed extremely well when coupled with feature selection techniques. They did, however, point out that ensemble models are computationally costly, which might hinder their utilization in real-time detection systems[8].

- Finally, a recent study by Patel et al. (2021) focused on the challenges and solutions related to real-time web application phishing detection using machine learning. They discussed the need for models that not only achieve high accuracy but also process data in real-time. Despite the good performance of models like SVM and Random Forest, their study showed that latency remained a significant issue when scaling these models for web traffic. Their findings demonstrated how important it is to speed up algorithms without sacrificing accuracy, which is essential for modern cybersecurity applications. They proposed several solutions, such as parallel processing and model compression techniques, to deal with these problems [9].

# Proposed Methodology:
- In this research, we propose the use of machine learning techniques to develop a vulnerability scanner for identifying phishing websites. The methodology involves training various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, on a dataset comprising over 11,000 website samples. Each sample includes 32 features, such as URL structure, domain length, use of HTTPS, and traffic patterns, which are indicative of phishing websites. The models are trained using a supervised learning approach, with the class label (phishing or legitimate) serving as the target variable. To improve model performance and reduce overfitting, we use a strong data preprocessing pipeline that includes feature selection and normalization. To ensure that the models are tested on unseen data for generalizability, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets in an 80-20 ratio.
- For model evaluation, we use key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the effectiveness of each model in detecting phishing websites. Random Forest and Support Vector Machines are expected to perform optimally based on prior research.We also use cross-validation techniques to further validate the results and avoid model bias. The final step compares the performance of each model using a comparative analysis that includes the visualization of confusion matrices and ROC curves. The suggested methodology aims to provide a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for automated phishing detection in real-time web applications with high precision and recall without compromising computational efficiency.

# Dataset:
- The dataset utilized in this investigation is sourced from a Kaggle repository that is publicly accessible and comprises over 11,000 website samples, each of which contains 32 features. These attributes, which are frequently associated with both legitimate and phishing websites, are derived from various aspects of website structures and behaviors. URL attributes such as URL length, HTTPS usage, domain registration details, and the presence of dubious components such as "@" symbols or lengthy URL paths are among the essential elements. In addition, the dataset comprises domain-specific data, such as the domain's age, website traffic, Google index status, and the presence of unusual URL patterns that may indicate phishing attempts. A binary class label is assigned to each entry, with 1 indicating a legitimate website and -1 indicating a phishing one.

- Before diving into the analysis, a lot of data preprocessing is required to get the dataset ready for machine learning models. This involves handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. The data is then split into two parts: 20% is set aside for testing, while the remaining 80% is used for training the models. The main aim here is to prevent overfitting and make sure the models are able to perform well on new, unseen data. The dataset is especially useful for building and testing machine learning-based vulnerability scanners, as it includes a diverse set of features that provide a comprehensive view of various phishing attack indicators.

# Data Preprocessing:
- Data preprocessing is a critical step in getting the dataset ready for machine learning model training and evaluation.  In this study, the raw dataset is first loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, which contains over 11,000 website samples and 32 features such as URL structure, domain name, and website traffic data.  The first step in preprocessing is to remove the 'Index' column, which does not contribute to the model's predictive power.  This is accomplished via the drop() method, which removes the column from the DataFrame [10].  Following that, the dataset is checked for missing or null values.  Because the dataset contains no missing values, no additional imputation is required, allowing for a smooth transition to the following steps.

- The dataset's features are subsequently scaled and normalized to enhance the efficacy of machine learning models. When utilizing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines, which exhibit sensitivity to variations in feature magnitude, scaling is essential. Normalizing or standardizing features ensures that all values are within a uniform range. This prevents a single feature from dominating the learning process. Subsequent to scaling the dataset, it is divided into input features (X) and target variables (y). X comprises 32 features, while y contains binary class labels (1 for real, -1 for fake). Twenty percent of the dataset is used for testing and eighty percent for model training.  This split is essential since it guarantees that the model can generalize properly by letting us assess how well it performs on fresh, unprocessed data [11].

- To improve the dataset, feature engineering is applied. This involves transforming any categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding, which is useful for features that consist of distinct categories. After preprocessing, the data becomes ready for machine learning models. The models will be taught to classify websites depending on the accessible characteristics. Preprocessing aims to guarantee a clean, consistent, well-structured dataset, so enabling training models that are accurate and efficient in spotting phishing efforts.
