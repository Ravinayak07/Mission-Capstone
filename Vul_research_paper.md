# Abstract:
- As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, the task of detecting security vulnerabilities has become a major challenge for modern cybersecurity. This study investigates how machine learning can be used to automate the detection of common security flaws in websites, with a focus on phishing attacks. The study examined a dataset containing more than 11,000 websites, with 32 distinct features, including URL structure, domain information, and traffic patterns. Various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, were tested during the analysis. Each model was assessed using important performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Of all the models tested, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines performed the best, achieving the highest accuracy and F1 scores. This paper highlights how machine learning can enhance vulnerability detection, making the process faster and more accurate. The findings suggest that machine learning tools have the potential to transform cybersecurity by speeding up threat detection and providing more insightful, context-aware risk assessments. Ultimately, these tools offer a scalable way to safeguard web applications and protect online systems from common vulnerabilities.

# Introduction:
- The swift advancement of digital technology is making our online spaces more susceptible to cyber threats with phishing attacks being particularly prominent. Both individuals and organizations now face difficulty recognizing phishing attacks because they have become more sophisticated. Phishing attacks deceive individuals into sharing sensitive data such as login credentials by impersonating credible entities [1]. Many cyber security tools are in widespread use but they fail to match the advanced attack techniques implemented by hackers. The situation demonstrates a rising demand for advanced automated systems able to detect these threats as they happen. The research investigates how machine learning techniques can develop a vulnerability scanner that detects frequent website security weaknesses, especially phishing attacks.

- Detecting security vulnerabilities in real-time remains a critical challenge within cyber security. Multiple solutions exist to tackle cyber security issues through rule-based scanners and manual audits but these approaches frequently operate at a slow pace and suffer from human mistakes. The deployment of machine learning techniques provides an effective solution to vulnerability detection through automated processes that enhance detection accuracy. Machine learning algorithms' growing application in cyber security now supports dynamic response systems that evolve alongside emerging threats. Many systems continue to depend on static rule sets which fail to identify fresh unknown vulnerabilities despite recent technological progress. The study seeks to overcome current limitations by developing a machine learning-based scanner which can autonomously spot phishing vulnerabilities while delivering tailored mitigation guidelines [2].

- Machine learning-based vulnerability detection offers some clear advantages over traditional methods. For starters, machine learning models are excellent at detecting evolving threats because they can analyze large datasets and uncover patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. Additionally, as more data becomes available, these models can continue to improve, making them more accurate and adaptable over time. That being said, using machine learning for phishing detection does come with its challenges. These include interpreting the models, especially in the context of cybersecurity, ensuring real-time data processing, and keeping the training data of high quality[3].

- This study examines the automated identification of website vulnerabilities, particularly phishing assaults, using machine learning. The objective is to develop a scanner that uses machine learning to evaluate multiple criteria, facilitating the differentiation of reliable websites from phishing ones.These features include things like URL structure, domain information, and traffic patterns—characteristics often found in phishing websites[3]. The study will test different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to find the most effective one for detecting phishing threats. The research will focus on two key ideas: (1) machine learning models can outperform traditional, rule-based methods in spotting phishing websites, and (2) models trained on a large, varied dataset will produce more accurate and reliable results[4]

- This Paper organized is as follows: An outline of the data collecting process and the preprocessing actions required in getting the dataset ready for model training will be given in the following part. A thorough discussion of the machine learning models applied in this work, together with their advantages and shortcomings in the framework of vulnerability detection, will follow here. The results of the model evaluations will be shown in the next part together with a comparison of the models' performance depending on important criteria including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results will then be examined in the discussion section together with possible difficulties and future directions for research, so addressing real-world application. At last, the paper will close by compiling the major contributions.

# Literature Review:
- Machine learning was the buzzword for detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the recent past. Numerous studies have been conducted on how machine learning can detect phishing attacks. One of them, for example, explored how phishing URLs can be separated based on their features using supervised models such as Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Smith et al., 2020). In detecting new phishing tactics, the study concluded that machine learning models are more dynamic and accurate compared to the rule-based method. It also emphasized the significance of feature engineering, highlighting as indicators of phishing pages domain names, URL lengths, and suspicious keywords[5]
