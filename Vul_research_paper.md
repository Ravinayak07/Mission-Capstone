# Abstract:
- As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, the task of detecting security vulnerabilities has become a major challenge for modern cybersecurity. This study investigates how machine learning can be used to automate the detection of common security flaws in websites, with a focus on phishing attacks. The study examined a dataset containing more than 11,000 websites, with 32 distinct features, including URL structure, domain information, and traffic patterns. Various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, were tested during the analysis. Each model was assessed using important performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Of all the models tested, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines performed the best, achieving the highest accuracy and F1 scores. This paper highlights how machine learning can enhance vulnerability detection, making the process faster and more accurate. The findings suggest that machine learning tools have the potential to transform cybersecurity by speeding up threat detection and providing more insightful, context-aware risk assessments. Ultimately, these tools offer a scalable way to safeguard web applications and protect online systems from common vulnerabilities.
