# Abstract:
- In today’s digital landscape, where security threats are constantly evolving, the need for proactive and intelligent vulnerability detection has become critical. This project presents the development of a machine learning-based vulnerability scanner designed to automate the identification of common security flaws in systems and applications. Unlike traditional tools that rely solely on static rule sets, this scanner integrates AI-driven models to assess the potential impact of detected vulnerabilities and provide actionable remediation suggestions. By training and evaluating multiple classifiers—including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Multi-layer Perceptrons—the system intelligently prioritizes threats based on severity and context. The result is a dynamic tool that not only accelerates the vulnerability assessment process but also enhances decision-making through data-driven insights. This approach bridges the gap between automated scanning and human-level analysis, contributing to more resilient and secure software development practices.
