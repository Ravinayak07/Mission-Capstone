# DECISION TREE:

A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the feature space into regions that are as homogenous as possible with respect to the target variable. The tree structure consists of nodes representing feature tests and branches representing the outcome of those tests. The tree is constructed in a top-down manner, where at each step, the algorithm selects the feature that best splits the data into distinct classes. The splitting criterion is typically chosen to maximize the information gain or minimize impurity in the resulting subsets. Common impurity measures include Gini impurity and entropy.

We begin by initializing a Decision Tree Classifier and fitting it to the training data. The process involves finding the optimal parameters, such as the maximum depth of the tree, to avoid overfitting. We iterate through a range of random_state values to ensure the robustness of the model. The random_state parameter ensures reproducibility of results across different runs. Finally, we evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data.

Once the tree is fully grown (or a stopping criterion is met), predictions are made by traversing the tree from the root node to a leaf node corresponding to the predicted class.

The Decision Tree model was trained to create a hierarchical structure of decision rules based on the input features. This structure helps in understanding which features are most important in predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.

By visualizing the decision tree, medical practitioners can interpret the rules used for classification, aiding in the understanding of risk factors and potential interventions for patients.

Decision Tree models are relatively easy to interpret, making them useful for generating insights into the relationship between risk factors and heart disease.

# RANDOM FORESTS:

The Random Forest model is an ensemble learning technique that constructs multiple decision trees during training. Each tree in the forest operates independently and contributes to the final prediction. Similar to the Decision Tree model, we iterate through a range of random_state values to find the optimal configuration. We evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. It constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Each tree in the forest is trained independently on a subset of the data and features, with replacement (bootstrapping). This randomness helps to decorrelate the trees and improve generalization performance. Random Forest combines the predictions of individual trees through voting (classification) or averaging (regression), which reduces overfitting and increases robustness. The number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of each tree are hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize performance.

Random Forests were employed to improve prediction accuracy and robustness compared to individual decision trees. By training multiple decision trees on different subsets of the data, Random Forests reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance. The Random Forest model's ability to handle high-dimensional datasets with a large number of features was advantageous in this project, where multiple health attributes were considered for heart disease diagnosis.

Additionally, Random Forests provide a feature importance score, indicating which features contribute most to the predictive performance. This information can guide medical professionals in identifying key risk factors for heart disease.

# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model Training

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple yet effective method for classification tasks. It classifies a data point based on the majority class of its neighbors. We scale the features before training the KNN model for better performance. Similar to the previous models, we iterate through a range of values for the number of neighbors (n_neighbors) to find the optimal configuration.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful non-parametric lazy learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In KNN, the prediction for a given data point is determined by the majority class (in classification) or the average value (in regression) of its K nearest neighbors. The distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) is used to measure the similarity between data points. Common choices for K include odd integers to avoid ties. KNN is computationally expensive during inference as it requires computing distances to all training instances. Therefore, it's essential to scale the features before training to ensure equal importance.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) was employed as a simple yet effective classification algorithm for heart disease detection. KNN makes predictions based on the similarity of a new data point to its nearest neighbors in the feature space. In this project, KNN helped in identifying similar patient profiles based on their health attributes. By considering the features of patients with known heart disease, KNN can classify new patients into the appropriate risk category. KNN's non-parametric nature makes it suitable for cases where the underlying distribution of data is unknown or non-linear. Its simplicity and ease of implementation were advantageous for quickly prototyping and evaluating different approaches for heart disease detection.
