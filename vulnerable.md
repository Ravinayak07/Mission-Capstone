# Abstract
- In today’s digital landscape, where security threats are constantly evolving, the need for proactive and intelligent vulnerability detection has become critical. This project presents the development of a machine learning-based vulnerability scanner designed to automate the identification of common security flaws in systems and applications. Unlike traditional tools that rely solely on static rule sets, this scanner integrates AI-driven models to assess the potential impact of detected vulnerabilities and provide actionable remediation suggestions. By training and evaluating multiple classifiers—including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Multi-layer Perceptrons—the system intelligently prioritizes threats based on severity and context. The result is a dynamic tool that not only accelerates the vulnerability assessment process but also enhances decision-making through data-driven insights. This approach bridges the gap between automated scanning and human-level analysis, contributing to more resilient and secure software development practices.

# Introduction
- n the age of increasing digitalization, the frequency and sophistication of cyber threats have grown significantly. Modern applications often comprise multiple layers of interconnected services, which expand the attack surface and introduce vulnerabilities. Organizations are under constant pressure to secure their systems without slowing down development. Manual vulnerability assessment is time-consuming and error-prone, often failing to keep pace with evolving threats. This calls for a more scalable and intelligent approach to identifying and addressing security issues [1].

- This research introduces a machine learning-based vulnerability scanner designed to automate the detection of common security flaws in software systems. The system leverages supervised learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Multi-layer Perceptrons, to predict the presence of vulnerabilities. Each model was trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring that both effectiveness and reliability were thoroughly measured. This approach not only increases scanning efficiency but also reduces false positives commonly associated with static rule-based systems [2].

- The scanner also incorporates AI-driven insights for contextual impact assessment and remediation recommendations. By analyzing patterns in the data and correlating them with known vulnerability signatures, the system can estimate the severity of a detected issue. These insights help developers and security teams prioritize which vulnerabilities to address first, based on risk level and potential impact. The AI-backed recommendations also suggest mitigation strategies, guiding users towards practical and secure fixes [3].

- The goal of this work is to bridge the gap between raw vulnerability detection and actionable security intelligence. With automation at its core and AI powering its decision-making layer, the scanner significantly reduces the manual effort needed in traditional security reviews. This not only streamlines the development lifecycle but also enforces stronger security postures across applications. The following sections detail the methodology, model training process, evaluation results, and practical implications of deploying such a system [4].

# Literature Review:

- Traditional vulnerability scanners such as Nessus and OpenVAS have long been foundational tools in cybersecurity. These tools primarily rely on signature-based scanning to detect known vulnerabilities, such as CVEs. However, as noted by Sabottke et al. (2015), these scanners often suffer from high false positive rates and struggle with zero-day vulnerabilities due to their limited contextual awareness and static rule sets. Additionally, these systems require significant manual oversight, which makes them inefficient in large-scale environments where automation is essential for rapid response[5].

- Machine learning (ML) offers a way to automate and improve vulnerability detection by learning patterns from existing data. Alshamrani et al. (2020) demonstrated the effectiveness of classifiers like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees in identifying flaws based on software metrics and code features. These models offer transparency and fast computation, making them suitable for real-time detection tasks. However, their simplicity can lead to suboptimal performance in complex systems where interactions between variables are non-linear and harder to capture using shallow models [6].

- To address this, ensemble techniques such as Random Forests have been proposed for their robustness and accuracy. According to Shin et al. (2015), Random Forest classifiers outperform single-tree methods by reducing overfitting and improving generalization. Our implementation confirms these findings, with Random Forest models achieving strong accuracy and recall rates across multiple datasets. Furthermore, their feature importance metrics enhance explainability, which is critical in cybersecurity applications where model outputs must be interpretable for decision-making [7].

- Recent advancements have explored the use of neural networks, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to detect vulnerabilities in source code and software configurations. Russell et al. (2018) showed that MLPs can successfully model complex relationships within code structures and are capable of identifying patterns that traditional ML models often miss. Our study integrates an MLP classifier to complement the other models, resulting in a holistic scanning tool that performs well even on subtle and obfuscated vulnerability signatures [8].

- Overall, the literature supports a growing shift toward AI-powered vulnerability assessment. While traditional tools remain useful for known threats, ML-based solutions offer adaptability, precision, and efficiency. Our research builds on this body of work by integrating supervised learning algorithms and augmenting them with an AI-based recommendation engine. This not only improves detection accuracy but also provides actionable remediation guidance, addressing both technical and operational gaps in conventional security workflows.

# Proposed Methodology:
- The proposed system is a machine learning-based vulnerability scanner that automates the detection of software flaws and provides AI-driven impact assessment and remediation suggestions. The methodology involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insight generation. First, the dataset is cleaned, encoded, and split into training and testing sets. Several supervised learning models are used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Each model is trained on software feature data to classify whether a vulnerability exists [9].

- Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among all models, Random Forest and MLP showed the best performance, effectively balancing detection accuracy and reducing false positives. Confusion matrices and classification reports support these findings. Finally, the system applies AI to estimate the severity of each detected flaw and suggests remediation strategies. These insights help developers prioritize fixes, improving both security and efficiency in the development lifecycle [10].

# Dataset:
- This research utilizes the Phishing Website Detector dataset, publicly available on Kaggle (Eswar Ch, 2021). The dataset comprises over 11,000 website records, each annotated with 30 distinct features and a binary class label indicating whether the website is legitimate (1) or phishing (-1). The dataset is provided in both .txt and .csv formats. The CSV version includes headers, which simplifies its use in machine learning applications.

- Each feature in the dataset reflects a specific characteristic of a website that may hint at malicious intent. These include URL-based indicators such as the presence of an IP address instead of a domain name (UsingIP), excessive URL length (LongURL), or the use of URL shortening services (ShortURL). Other features evaluate suspicious syntax, redirect patterns, the presence of subdomains, and HTTPS usage, all of which can influence a website's credibility.

- Beyond structural elements, the dataset also incorporates behavioral signals, such as the use of popup windows, right-click disabling, and iframe redirection. These are common strategies used by phishing websites to mislead users or restrict normal browser actions. Features related to domain registration length, DNS records, and Google indexing also contribute to the overall security assessment.

- The final feature, labeled class, denotes whether the website is considered safe or malicious. All features are encoded as categorical values in the form of -1, 0, or 1, representing negative, neutral, or positive security traits. This encoding makes the dataset highly compatible with classification algorithms used in supervised machine learning.
