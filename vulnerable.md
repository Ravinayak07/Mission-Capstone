# Abstract
- In today’s digital landscape, where security threats are constantly evolving, the need for proactive and intelligent vulnerability detection has become critical. This project presents the development of a machine learning-based vulnerability scanner designed to automate the identification of common security flaws in systems and applications. Unlike traditional tools that rely solely on static rule sets, this scanner integrates AI-driven models to assess the potential impact of detected vulnerabilities and provide actionable remediation suggestions. By training and evaluating multiple classifiers—including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Multi-layer Perceptrons—the system intelligently prioritizes threats based on severity and context. The result is a dynamic tool that not only accelerates the vulnerability assessment process but also enhances decision-making through data-driven insights. This approach bridges the gap between automated scanning and human-level analysis, contributing to more resilient and secure software development practices.

# Introduction
- n the age of increasing digitalization, the frequency and sophistication of cyber threats have grown significantly. Modern applications often comprise multiple layers of interconnected services, which expand the attack surface and introduce vulnerabilities. Organizations are under constant pressure to secure their systems without slowing down development. Manual vulnerability assessment is time-consuming and error-prone, often failing to keep pace with evolving threats. This calls for a more scalable and intelligent approach to identifying and addressing security issues [1].

- This research introduces a machine learning-based vulnerability scanner designed to automate the detection of common security flaws in software systems. The system leverages supervised learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Multi-layer Perceptrons, to predict the presence of vulnerabilities. Each model was trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring that both effectiveness and reliability were thoroughly measured. This approach not only increases scanning efficiency but also reduces false positives commonly associated with static rule-based systems [2].

- The scanner also incorporates AI-driven insights for contextual impact assessment and remediation recommendations. By analyzing patterns in the data and correlating them with known vulnerability signatures, the system can estimate the severity of a detected issue. These insights help developers and security teams prioritize which vulnerabilities to address first, based on risk level and potential impact. The AI-backed recommendations also suggest mitigation strategies, guiding users towards practical and secure fixes [3].

- The goal of this work is to bridge the gap between raw vulnerability detection and actionable security intelligence. With automation at its core and AI powering its decision-making layer, the scanner significantly reduces the manual effort needed in traditional security reviews. This not only streamlines the development lifecycle but also enforces stronger security postures across applications. The following sections detail the methodology, model training process, evaluation results, and practical implications of deploying such a system [4].
