Parkinson's disease (PD) is a condition that affects millions of people globally, leading to a decline in motor function and the development of various symptoms. Detecting PD early is essential for timely treatment. This research investigates the use of machine learning methods to accurately detect PD using clinical data, which includes information gathered from voice recordings and demographic details. The data was prepared by addressing missing values, standardizing features, and analyzing distributions to better understand the data patterns. Through correlation analysis, relationships between different features were identified.

Several machine learning algorithms were tested, such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector classifier, Gaussian naive Bayes, and ensemble methods like the stacking classifier. The results indicated promising accuracy in identifying PD based on acoustic features, with the stacking classifier showing particularly strong performance. These findings have significant implications for leveraging machine learning in the early diagnosis of PD, leading to improved healthcare interventions and better outcomes for individuals affected by the disease.
