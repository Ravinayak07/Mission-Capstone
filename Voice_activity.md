# Introduction:
- Demand for more intelligent and context-aware voice interfaces in recent years has driven research on VAD systems capable of managing not only speaker differentiation, emotional tone, and environment classification but also speech detection. This has spurred research on hybrid architectures combining CNNs with transformer-based components able to vary temporal features depending on their contextual relevance or with attention mechanisms. These models not only find speech more precisely but also provide information on the speaker's intention or the type of the background surroundings. These developments capture the increasing complexity and expectations placed on voice-based systems in contemporary human-computer interaction configurations.

# Literature Review:
- Moreover remarkable in recent studies is the use of attention-based models—especially transformers—for VAD tasks. Long-range dependencies in audio sequences define accurate separation between speech and non-speech areas in noisy surroundings; these models excel in capturing these aspects. For instance, the transformer-based VAD model developed by Kim et al. 2020 suppressed meaningless background noise and enhanced sensitivity to speech transitions by means of multi-head self-attention layers. Their results outperformed traditional RNN-based models especially in datasets including complex acoustic environments. This suggests that in useful environments, including attention mechanisms, VAD resilience and accuracy can be considerably raised [21].
- Still another significant advance in VAD research is the integration of pre-trained transformer models—such as Wav2Vec2-XLS-R—into end-to- end VAD architectures. Using the capabilities of Wav2Vec2-XLS-R, Karan et al. (2024) presented a transformer-based VAD system to raise speech detection accuracy. Their model outperformed commercial VAD solutions and conventional CNN-BiLSTM systems with an area under the curve (AUC) of 96.2%. on the AVA-Speech data. Particularly, the transformer-based approach performed rather well in several acoustic environments—including underfunded multilingual speech conditions. This work highlights how transformer configurations might support the increase in VAD system resilience and accuracy in useful applications.

# Proposed Methodology:
- We also present a hybrid training approach combining supervised learning with data augmentation methods to improve the dependability of the proposed VAD system even more. We specifically use noise injection, time stretching, and pitch shifting to the audio training set to enhance the generalisation of the model over different acoustic environments. This not only makes the dataset more varied but also gets the model ready to manage real-world situations including background noise or overlapping speech. Furthermore, we use transfer learning from pre-trained audio models to accelerate convergence and enhance feature representation, so refining the architecture. These integrated approaches seek to make the suggested VAD system robust in practical deployment environments and accurate as well.
