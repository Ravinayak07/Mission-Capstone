i.	DenseNet is a type of neural network that requires fewer parameters than a regular CNN. This is because it does not train redundant maps. It consists of a thin layer with only twelve filters, generating a small number of feature vectors. There are different versions of DenseNet, such as DenseNet201, DenseNet264, DenseNet121 and DenseNet169. In this study, DenseNet264 is used to detect pneumonia. In DenseNet, each layer can see the loss function and gradient values from the real image. This means that it can learn better from the given data.
