ResNet, or Residual Neural Network, stands out as a groundbreaking architecture in deep learning, particularly renowned for its capacity to train remarkably deep networks efficiently. Its design diverges from conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by incorporating residual connections, which enable the direct flow of information through the network. This innovation tackles the challenge of vanishing gradients encountered in deep networks by facilitating the learning of residual functions with respect to the input. With ResNet, each layer has the ability to access both the loss function and gradient values from the real image data, enhancing its learning capability. This unique architecture allows ResNet to effectively learn intricate features and hierarchical representations, ultimately leading to superior performance in various image recognition tasks, including medical imaging applications such as pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images
