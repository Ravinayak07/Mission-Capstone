Dataset Balancing:
This section addresses the considerable dataset imbalance, where Parkinson Disease samples account for 147 instances, while non-Parkinson samples are only 48. Therefore, we employ SMOTE in this section to oversample and achieve a balanced dataset.


Data Loading and Exploration:

Loading the heart disease dataset using pandas.
Exploring the dataset's shape, first few rows, random samples, and basic statistical information.
Displaying information about each column in the dataset.
Visualizing the distribution of the target variable and other key features using various plots like pie charts, bar plots, and distribution plots.

Data Preprocessing:

Split the dataset into predictors (features) and target variables.
Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
Scale the features using StandardScaler for better performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Model Training: Train three machine learning models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Training a hybrid model that combines predictions from Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN.

Model Evaluation:
Calculate accuracy scores for each model using metrics such as accuracy_score from scikit-learn.

Model Saving:
Create a Gaussian Naive Bayes model.
Fit the model on the training data.
Save the trained model to a file using pickle for future use.
