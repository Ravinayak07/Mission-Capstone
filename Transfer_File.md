- Stock market forecasting has been an active area of research, with various approaches ranging from classical statistical models to modern machine learning techniques. Early studies relied heavily on econometric models such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH), which aimed to capture the time-dependent structure of financial data [5]. While these models have demonstrated reasonable forecasting capabilities, they struggle with the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in stock market movements. To address these limitations, machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest have been explored to enhance predictive accuracy [6].

- In recent years, deep learning models, particularly LSTM networks, have been widely applied in stock price prediction due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Researchers have found that LSTMs outperform traditional time-series models by effectively learning complex patterns in stock price fluctuations [7]. However, while these models significantly improve forecasting accuracy, they often rely solely on historical price data and neglect external factors such as investor sentiment, which can influence stock movements. This has led to an increasing interest in integrating sentiment analysis into predictive models.

- Sentiment analysis has emerged as a valuable tool in financial forecasting, particularly with the rise of social media platforms like Twitter. Bollen et al. [8] demonstrated that Twitter sentiment can serve as a leading indicator for stock market trends, revealing that fluctuations in public mood correlate with market movements. Additionally, research by Smailović et al. [9] highlighted the effectiveness of combining sentiment scores with traditional market indicators to improve stock price prediction models. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in refining sentiment analysis techniques to accurately capture market sentiment and filter out noise from irrelevant or misleading information.

- A hybrid approach that integrates sentiment analysis with machine learning models has shown promising results in financial forecasting. Studies have indicated that combining traditional technical indicators, such as moving averages and Relative Strength Index (RSI), with sentiment scores from social media improves model performance [10]. However, optimizing this approach requires careful feature selection and data preprocessing techniques to ensure that sentiment information effectively contributes to the predictive power of stock price models. The proposed study builds on these findings by integrating both sentiment analysis and technical indicators using a combination of Random Forest and LSTM networks to enhance stock market forecasting accuracy
