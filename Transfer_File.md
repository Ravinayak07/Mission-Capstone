Introduction
Stock market forecasting is a dynamic and intricate challenge influenced by an array of variables, including historical trends, macroeconomic indicators, geopolitical events, and investor psychology. Traditional models for predicting stock prices primarily rely on statistical methods and machine learning algorithms applied to time-series data. However, these methods often fail to capture the impact of public sentiment, which plays a crucial role in financial markets. Sentiment analysis, particularly from social media platforms like Twitter, has emerged as a complementary approach to enhance prediction accuracy by incorporating public opinion into market analysis [1].
Twitter has gained recognition as a real-time information-sharing platform where investors, analysts, and the general public express their sentiments regarding market trends. Prior research suggests that fluctuations in stock prices often correlate with shifts in investor sentiment observed on social media. By analyzing Twitter data, researchers have identified patterns that indicate market movements, reinforcing the idea that public mood significantly influences stock trends. The increasing adoption of natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis techniques in finance has demonstrated promising results in predicting stock price fluctuations [2].
Machine learning techniques, particularly ensemble models such as Random Forest and deep learning architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown remarkable performance in stock market prediction. Random Forest is known for its robustness in handling nonlinear data and reducing overfitting, making it well-suited for financial applications. On the other hand, LSTM networks, a specialized form of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), excel at capturing long-term dependencies and sequential relationships in stock price movements. By integrating these models with sentiment analysis, researchers aim to build more comprehensive forecasting systems that leverage both quantitative and qualitative factors [3].
This study aims to develop a hybrid model that integrates sentiment analysis with technical indicators to improve the accuracy of stock price predictions. The proposed approach combines real-time Twitter sentiment scores with traditional stock market indicators, allowing the model to capture both numerical trends and investor psychology. The research highlights the potential benefits of incorporating social media-driven sentiment into stock market prediction models and explores the extent to which such an approach can enhance forecasting reliability. This interdisciplinary method represents a step forward in financial modeling by bridging traditional econometric techniques with advancements in artificial intelligence and data science [4].
