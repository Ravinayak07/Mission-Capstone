I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to request leave from May 26th to June 13th (15 working days) for my upcoming marriage. I would be grateful if you could approve this leave period.

Additionally, I kindly request your permission to work from home until July 31st. This arrangement would greatly assist me in spending quality time with my new family and adjusting to the new changes in my life.

Please rest assured that I will be available to assist with any urgent matters during this period.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration of my requests. Thank you in advance for your support.
