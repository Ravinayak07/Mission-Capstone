We put together our Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system using a convolutional neural network (CNN), with the goal of making it actually usable in messy, real-world audio situations. Instead of going the traditional route with pre-set features, we had the model learn directly from spectrograms—basically those heatmap-like visuals that show how frequencies change over time in a sound clip. To make the training data realistic, we mixed in all kinds of audio—male and female voices, and also just plain noise—to make sure the model didn’t get too comfortable with ideal conditions.
To give the model more flexibility, we messed around with the training data using a bunch of augmentation tricks. We shifted audio a little in time, changed the pitch, tossed in background sounds, and cropped the clips in random places. These tweaks helped the model handle the kinds of unpredictability you’d find in real recordings. Plus, it kept the model from just memorizing the data instead of actually learning useful patterns.
When it came to training, we kept things stable using a few proven methods. One was early stopping—which is just a way of saying “stop training when it stops getting better.” It saves time and helps prevent overfitting. Another one was adjusting the learning rate when things started to level off, so the model could fine-tune itself instead of getting stuck.
We also gave transfer learning a shot in some cases. That’s where you take a model that’s already learned from a big, general dataset and fine-tune it for your specific task. It gave us a head start, especially when we didn’t have tons of training data to work with. In the end, this whole approach came together nicely. The system held up pretty well across different voices and noisy conditions—and that’s really what we were aiming for.

We thought about training from scratch, but then figured — why not try transfer learning? So yeah, we used a model that had already learned from a large audio dataset. That way, it already “knew” how to pick up basic sound patterns, and we didn’t have to start from zero. It helped a lot, especially when we had smaller or super specific datasets. Honestly, it saved time too — training was smoother, and results were better. When we added this to everything else we were doing, the model handled most types of audio pretty well — clean speech, background noise, and the in-between stuff too.
