- The dataset used in this study consists of two key components: historical stock price data and Twitter sentiment data. The stock market data was sourced from Yahoo Finance, covering a time span from January 2015 to December 2023 for multiple stock indices, including SENSEX, NASDAQ, and NIFTY50. The dataset contains daily records of key financial indicators: Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. These indicators help assess the market trend, volatility, and trading activity, which are essential factors in predicting stock prices accurately.
- The sentiment dataset was collected using Twitter API (Tweepy) and filtered for stock-related keywords such as "market trends," "stock up/down," and specific company names. The data collected was then analyzed using VADER Sentiment Analysis to classify tweets as positive, neutral, or negative. A total of 500,000 tweets were analyzed over a 5-year period [7]. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of how public sentiment affects stock movements, allowing us to correlate sentiment trends with price fluctuations. Moreover, cleaning and preprocessing the raw Twitter data ensured that irrelevant tweets, bot-generated content, and spam were excluded, improving the sentiment analysis accuracy.
