##
- The dataset used in this study consists of two key components: historical stock price data and Twitter sentiment data. The stock market data was sourced from Yahoo Finance, covering a time span from January 2015 to December 2023 for multiple stock indices, including SENSEX, NASDAQ, and NIFTY50. The dataset contains daily records of key financial indicators: Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. These indicators play a crucial role in understanding stock market trends and assessing potential fluctuations, helping traders and analysts make informed investment decisions.
- The sentiment dataset was collected using Twitter API (Tweepy) and filtered for stock-related keywords such as "market trends," "stock up/down," and specific company names. The data collected was then analyzed using VADER Sentiment Analysis to classify tweets as positive, neutral, or negative. A total of 500,000 tweets were analyzed over a 5-year period [7]. To ensure high-quality sentiment data, irrelevant tweets, advertisements, and automated bot-generated posts were filtered out before analysis. The combination of stock price indicators and sentiment scores allows for a more comprehensive examination of the relationship between market sentiment and stock price movements, enhancing predictive accuracy.
