I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to formally request leave from May 26th to June 13th (15 working days) in light of my upcoming marriage. I would be truly grateful for your support and approval of this leave.

Additionally, I would like to kindly request your permission to work from home until July 31st, post my return from leave. This arrangement would greatly help me transition smoothly into this new chapter of my life and allow me to balance personal and professional responsibilities during this time.

Please rest assured that I will remain fully committed to my responsibilities and will be available to support any urgent matters while working remotely.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to your approval.
